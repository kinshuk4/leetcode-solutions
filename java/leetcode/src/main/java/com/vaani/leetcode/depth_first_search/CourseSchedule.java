/** https://leetcode.com/problems/course-schedule/
 * There are a total of n courses you have to take,
 * labeled from 0 to n - 1.
 *
 * <p>Some courses may have prerequisites, for example to take course 0 you have to first take
 * course 1, which is expressed as a pair: [0,1]
 *
 * <p>Given the total number of courses and a list of prerequisite pairs, is it possible for you to
 * finish all courses?
 *
 * <p>For example:
 *
 * <p>2, [[1,0]] There are a total of 2 courses to take. To take course 1 you should have finished
 * course 0. So it is possible.
 *
 * <p>2, [[1,0],[0,1]] There are a total of 2 courses to take. To take course 1 you should have
 * finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should also have finished course 1. So it is
 * impossible.
 *
 * <p>Note: The input prerequisites is a graph represented by a list of edges, not adjacency
 * matrices. Read more about how a graph is represented. You may assume that there are no duplicate
 * edges in the input prerequisites.
 *
 * <p>Solution: 1. Topologically sort the vertices. 2. Pick each sorted vertex and mark each of its
 * neighbours as visited, if you encounter a vertex which is already visited then return false
 * otherwise return true
