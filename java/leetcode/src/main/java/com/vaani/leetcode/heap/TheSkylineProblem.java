 *
 * <p>A city's skyline is the outer contour of the silhouette formed by all the buildings in that
 * city when viewed from a distance. Now suppose you are given the locations and height of all the
 * buildings as shown on a cityscape photo (Figure A), write a program to output the skyline formed
 * by these buildings collectively (Figure B).
 *
 * <p>
 *
 * <p>See below link for image. https://leetcode.com/problems/the-skyline-problem/description/
 *
 * <p>
 *
 * <p>Buildings Skyline Contour The geometric information of each building is represented by a
 * triplet of integers [Li, Ri, Hi], where Li and Ri are the x coordinates of the left and right
 * vertex of the ith building, respectively, and Hi is its height. It is guaranteed that 0 ≤ Li, Ri ≤
 * INT_MAX, 0 < Hi ≤ INT_MAX, and Ri - Li > 0. You may assume all buildings are perfect rectangles
 * grounded on an absolutely flat surface at height 0.
 *
 * <p>For instance, the dimensions of all buildings in Figure A are recorded as: [ [2 9 10], [3 7
 * 15], [5 12 12], [15 20 10], [19 24 8] ] .
 *
 * <p>The output is a list of "key points" (red dots in Figure B) in the format of [ [x1,y1], [x2,
 * y2], [x3, y3], ... ] that uniquely defines a skyline. A key point is the left endpoint of a
 * horizontal line segment. Note that the last key point, where the rightmost building ends, is
 * merely used to mark the termination of the skyline, and always has zero height. Also, the ground
 * in between any two adjacent buildings should be considered part of the skyline contour.
 *
 * <p>For instance, the skyline in Figure B should be represented as:[ [2 10], [3 15], [7 12], [12
 * 0], [15 10], [20 8], [24, 0] ].
 *
 * <p>Notes:
 *
 * <p>The number of buildings in any input list is guaranteed to be in the range [0, 10000]. The
 * input list is already sorted in ascending order by the left x position Li. The output list must
 * be sorted by the x position. There must be no consecutive horizontal lines of equal height in the
 * output skyline. For instance, [...[2 3], [4 5], [7 5], [11 5], [12 7]...] is not acceptable; the
 * three lines of height 5 should be merged into one in the final output as such: [...[2 3], [4 5],
 * [12 7], ...]
 *
 * <p>Solution: 1. Sort array of points. Each point here is either a start of a rectangle or end of
 * a rectangle. 2. Maintain a priority queue of rectangles ordered by increasing order of height, if
 * height of two rectangle is same then, order by left most start index. 3. For each point starting
 * from left-most point: 3.a. Add all the rectangles which starts at this point. 3.b. Remove all the
 * rectangles which ends at this point. Keep a max of height for each rectangle removed. 3.c. If the
 * current priority queue is empty then, include current point (x, 0) to the result set. This
 * indicates this was the last rectangle and after this there is a gap of at least 1 unit.
 *
 * <p>If the max calculated in step b is greater than current max then, include current x and max
 * height from priority queue to the result set. This indicates one of the larger rectangle's right
 * vertex intersects with a smaller one.
 *
 * <p>If the max calculated in stop b is smaller then check if the peek element in priority queue
 * has the left vertex value equal to current point. If so, then this indicates that a new larger
 * rectangle starts from this point therefore add this point to the result set. 4. Return the result
 * set
