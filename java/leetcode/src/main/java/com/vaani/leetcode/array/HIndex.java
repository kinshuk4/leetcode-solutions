 * 274. H-Index
 * Medium
 * Given an array of citations (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher,
 * write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.
 *
 * <p>According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: "A scientist has index h if h of his/her
 * N papers have at least h citations each, and the other N âˆ’ h papers have no more than h citations
 * each."
 *
 * <p>For example, given citations = [3, 0, 6, 1, 5], which means the researcher has 5 papers in
 * total and each of them had received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively. Since the researcher
 * has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining two with no more than 3 citations
 * each, his h-index is 3.
 *
 * <p>Note: If there are several possible values for h, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.
