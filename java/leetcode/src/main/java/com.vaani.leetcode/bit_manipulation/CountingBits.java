/**
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/counting-bits/
 * <p>
 * Given a non negative integer number num. For every numbers i in the range 0 ≤ i ≤ num calculate the number of 1's in their binary representation and return them as an array.
 * <p>
 * Example 1:
 * <p>
 * Input: 2
 * Output: [0,1,1]
 * Example 2:
 * <p>
 * Input: 5
 * Output: [0,1,1,2,1,2]
 * Follow up:
 * <p>
 * It is very easy to come up with a solution with run time O(n*sizeof(integer)). But can you do it in linear time O(n) /possibly in a single pass?
 * Space complexity should be O(n).
 * Can you do it like a boss? Do it without using any builtin function like __builtin_popcount in c++ or in any other language.
